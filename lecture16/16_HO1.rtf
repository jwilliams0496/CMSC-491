If you hadn’t noticed, I’m kind of preoccupied with finding healthier versions of classic recipes.  It’s not that we are a perfectly disciplined family who only eats the purest of pure foods-because that’s not us.  My husband requires take-out pizza at least once a week or he will essentially cease to exist.  My toddler is a snack fanatic and would be perfectly happy subsiding on crackers and cheese sticks.  And as for me?  I have great intentions but I’ll generally eat any food I happen upon. This is why I make it a point to try to incorporate some awesomely nutritious plant foods into our meals whenever I can.  Unfortunately, I’m the only one in the house who gets excited about vegetables and fruits, so I have to make these wholesome foods a little more exciting for the others.  This 3 Ingredient Tropical Ice Cream is one way to really make fruits shine. After a whirl in a food processor or powerful blender, the combination of frozen mango, frozen banana, and coconut milk take on a soft serve consistency perfectly ready to dish out on the spot.  However, you can pour the creamy mixture into a container and freeze for a more scoopable, ice cream-like frozen treat. The result is a slightly sweet, super creamy, melt-in-your-mouth treat evoking some serious island vibes. 3 INGREDIENT TROPICAL ICE CREAM Recipe adapted from The Pantry of Eden.
